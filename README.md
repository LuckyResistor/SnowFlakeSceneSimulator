Snowflake Scene Simulator
=========================

This is a simple scene simulator for the snowflake decoration. You can simulate the look of the scene before compiling a firmware and upload it to the snowflake board.

Status
------

Version 1.0.0 is a stable version I created in under two hours. It is just a proof of concept and a very good starting point. Feel free to contribute to this project.

Requirements
------------

This application compiles on any operating system. Just download and install the open-source Qt creator from here:

https://www.qt.io/download-open-source

Install the creator with Qt 5.12.6 or any newer version.

Open the `SnowFlakeSceneSimulator.pro` and edit your scene in the `Firmware/scene/User.cpp` and `Firmware/scene/User.hpp` file. If you run the application, a window opens simulating your scene.
